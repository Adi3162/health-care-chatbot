This project is a smart, AI-powered Healthcare Chatbot that utilizes OpenAI's ChatGPT API to provide conversational support for users seeking basic health-related guidance. The chatbot can interact with users in natural language, offering helpful responses to general health queries, symptom checks, wellness tips, and moreâ€”simulating the experience of speaking with a virtual health assistant.
